Simple webpage and PHP class to get cable modem information
via SNMP

Requires a docsisserver style docsismodem database to work
but if you use dynamic DNS with isc DHCP you can use the PEAR
Package for DNS Queries for name to IP resolution in my case I
used the commited "hook" from isc dhcp server.
